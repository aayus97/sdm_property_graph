This project leverages graph-based solutions to enhance data management and analytics within our Big Data Management (BDM) system. By representing our data as a graph, we can efficiently explore complex relationships, conduct advanced analytics, and derive insights that are difficult to achieve with traditional relational databases. This report outlines the methodology, implementation, and benefits of employing graph-based solutions, culminating in a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the process.
